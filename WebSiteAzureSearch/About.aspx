Many applications and websites use search as a primary tool for customer interaction—and customers expect high-level relevance, suggestions, multiple languages, faceting, and near-instantaneous responses.
Easily add sophisticated cloud search capabilities to your website or application using the same integrated Microsoft natural language stack that's used in Bing and Office and that’s been improved over 16 years. Quickly tune search results and construct rich, fine-tuned ranking models to tie search results to business goals. Reliable throughput and storage give you fast search indexing and querying to support time-sensitive search scenarios.
